# Password Generator - beta

I do not want to use any online password generator to store my password, but I want to remember password easily, but easy is not secure, to make password unguessable and secure. Any given text or string it will generate a small hash.

## Todo(s)
### Add complexity or levels on password
Add more functions to make password more complex, or include level to generate 16 characters or 32 characters of password

### Visibility options
Add visible or by default password not visible to user, it will simply copy the password to clipboard and than user can simply paste it
